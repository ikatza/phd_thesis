	abstract = {The {MiniBooNE} experiment at Fermilab reports results from an analysis of νe appearance data from 12.84×1020 protons on target in neutrino mode, an increase of approximately a factor of 2 over previously reported results. A νe charged-current quasielastic event excess of 381.2±85.2 events (4.5σ) is observed in the energy range 200{\textless}{EQEν}{\textless}1250 {MeV}. Combining these data with the ¯νe appearance data from 11.27×1020 protons on target in antineutrino mode, a total νe plus ¯νe charged-current quasielastic event excess of 460.5±99.0 events (4.7σ) is observed. If interpreted in a two-neutrino oscillation model, νμ→νe, the best oscillation fit to the excess has a probability of 21.1\%, while the background-only fit has a χ2 probability of 6×10−7 relative to the best fit. The {MiniBooNE} data are consistent in energy and magnitude with the excess of events reported by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector ({LSND}), and the significance of the combined {LSND} and {MiniBooNE} excesses is 6.0σ. A two-neutrino oscillation interpretation of the data would require at least four neutrino types and indicate physics beyond the three neutrino paradigm. Although the data are fit with a two-neutrino oscillation model, other models may provide better fits to the data.},

	abstract = {A search for sub-{GeV} dark matter produced from collisions of the Fermilab 8 {GeV} Booster protons with a steel beam dump was performed by the {MiniBooNE}-{DM} Collaboration using data from 1.86×1020 protons on target in a dedicated run. The {MiniBooNE} detector, consisting of 818 tons of mineral oil and located 490 meters downstream of the beam dump, is sensitive to a variety of dark matter initiated scattering reactions. Three dark matter interactions are considered for this analysis: elastic scattering off nucleons, inelastic neutral pion production, and elastic scattering off electrons. Multiple data sets were used to constrain flux and systematic errors, and time-of-flight information was employed to increase sensitivity to higher dark matter masses. No excess from the background predictions was observed, and 90\% confidence level limits were set on the vector portal and leptophobic dark matter models. New parameter space is excluded in the vector portal dark matter model with a dark matter mass between 5 and 50 {MeV} c−2. The reduced neutrino flux allowed to test if the {MiniBooNE} neutrino excess scales with the production of neutrinos. No excess of neutrino oscillation events were measured ruling out models that scale solely by number of protons on target independent of beam configuration at 4.6σ.},

	abstract = {The {MiniBooNE}-{DM} Collaboration searched for vector-boson mediated production of dark matter using the Fermilab 8-{GeV} Booster proton beam in a dedicated run with 1.86×1020 protons delivered to a steel beam dump. The {MiniBooNE} detector, 490 m downstream, is sensitive to dark matter via elastic scattering with nucleons in the detector mineral oil. Analysis methods developed for previous {MiniBooNE} scattering results were employed, and several constraining data sets were simultaneously analyzed to minimize systematic errors from neutrino flux and interaction rates. No excess of events over background was observed, leading to a 90\% confidence limit on the dark matter cross section parameter, Y=ε2{αD}(mχ/{mV})4≲10−8, for αD=0.5 and for dark matter masses of 0.01{\textless}mχ{\textless}0.3 {GeV} in a vector portal model of dark matter. This is the best limit from a dedicated proton beam dump search in this mass and coupling range and extends below the mass range of direct dark matter searches. These results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to dark matter searches with beam dump experiments.},
